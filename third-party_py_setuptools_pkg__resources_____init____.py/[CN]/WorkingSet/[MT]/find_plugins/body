The `full_env`, if supplied, should be an ``Environment``\n        contains all currently-available distributions.  If `full_env` is not\n        supplied, one is created automatically from the ``WorkingSet`` this\n        method is called on, which will typically mean that every directory on\n        ``sys.path`` will be scanned for distributions.\n\n        `installer` is a standard installer callback as used by the\n        ``resolve()`` method. The `fallback` flag indicates whether we should\n        attempt to resolve older versions of a plugin if the newest version\n        cannot be resolved.\n\n        This method returns a 2-tuple: (`distributions`, `error_info`), where\n        `distributions` is a list of the distributions found in `plugin_env`\n        that were loadable, along with any other distributions that are needed\n        to resolve their dependencies.  `error_info` is a dictionary mapping\n        unloadable plugin distributions to an exception instance describing the\n        error that occurred. Usually this will be a ``DistributionNotFound`` or\n        ``VersionConflict`` instance.\n        '
